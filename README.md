Iris Flower Classification using Decision Tree | Internship Project
# ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Classification

This is my second AI/ML internship project under **Cloudcredits**.  
In this project, I used a **Decision Tree Classifier** to predict the species of an iris flower based on its sepal and petal measurements.

## ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement

Classify iris flowers into one of three species:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

Using the following features:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

## ðŸ§  Machine Learning Model

- **Algorithm**: Decision Tree Classifier
- **Accuracy Achieved**: _Replace this with your accuracy (e.g., 96%)_
- **Evaluation**: Confusion Matrix, Classification Report

---

## ðŸ§ª Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Pandas

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Output

- Confusion Matrix Heatmap
- Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
- Pairplot of features
